## **Description**

In order to streamline the ReadMe writing process for application projects I created a simple and easy to use node application. This application uses Inquirer to ask the user questions about their project and uses the answers to auto generate a ReadMe file. Creating a ReadMe with this application provides a clean and quick way to get a professional looking ReadMe as JavaScript and Node take on most of the work. By creating this application I was able to practice usage of Node.js and many of its packages as well as using dependencies and scripts like in the Package.json files. Although this was a refactoring assignment, I did write most of the code once I understood what functions I was supposed to follow and use. 

## **Installation & Usage**
Initiate Node.js by running ‘npm i’ in the GitBash terminal. Once all packages have been installed simply run the ‘node index.js’ command to run the application. This will begin the prompt of questions and ultimately write the ReadMe file using user inputted answers. See below for walkthrough video.
